# Tableau - Quick Table Caculations and separate color legends

In this post, I practice how to use Tableau's Superstore data source to implement Quick Table Calculations and separate color legends.

Start by opening Tableau and importing the Superstore data source. 
<br>This dataset contains various information such as Sales, Quantity, Profit, and Discount, allowing for diverse analyses.

To represent the quarter-over-quarter changes as percentages for each measure you can use ```Quick Table Caculation```

- Right-click on each measure and select ```Quick Table Calculation``` > ```Percent Difference```

To visually convey the change rates more clearly, Set a color legend. We can differentiate positive changes from negative ones using two colors.

In this example, I tried how to effectively visualize quarter-over-quarter performance using Quick Table Calculations and separate color legends in Tableau. 

I referred to [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53aclDHG358) for guidance.
